# Bank Cashier Queue System - Deliverable 01

This repository contains the Deliverable 01 submission for the Performance Modeling Mini Project. 
The selected system is a Bank Cashier Queue, where customers arrive randomly and wait in line to be served by available cashiers. 
The main objective is to study performance factors such as customer waiting time and cashier utilization.
A small simulated dataset of 15 customers is included to demonstrate arrivals and service times.
Future steps will include running queue analysis and preparing the final performance report.
